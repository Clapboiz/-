**Simulators and Emulators difference**

| Criterion          | Simulators                                         | Emulators                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Simulate the behavior of a system in a virtual environment. | Emulate the internal functions of hardware.      |
| **Operation**      | Focuses on simulating the external behavior.        | Emulates CPU, memory, and peripherals to run target system's machine code. |
| **Applications**   | Software development, environment simulation.      | Running software on incompatible hardware.       |
| **Simulation**     | Behavior and reactions of the system.              | Hardware and internal structure of the target system. |
| **Used in**        | Application development, testing, research.        | Software development, testing, retro gaming emulation. |
